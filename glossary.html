                        <p class="font-weight-normal">Laparoscopic (with a small scope) or vaginal procedures that avoid large incisions and more painful recovery and scar formation. These procedures allow the diagnosis of gynecologic problems and surgical removal of organs, cysts, scar tissue, and biopsies of tissue. These include Diagnostic Laparoscopy, Operative Laparoscopy, Tubal Ligation, Cystectomy, Hysterectomy.</p>
                    <a id="steril" class="font-weight-bold">Sterilization</a>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">Removal or clamping of the Fallopian tubes to prevent pregnancy. This may be done through a small scope and does not require a hospital stay. Also called Tubal Ligation. </p>
                    <a id="cyst" class="font-weight-bold">Cystectomy</a>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">Removal and most often testing of a cyst (fluid-filled structure) usually found on the ovaries. Most ovarian cysts are benign and do not require removal. Usually done through tiny incisions as an outpatient.</p>
                    <a id="myom" class="font-weight-bold">Myomectomy</a>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">Removal of a benign muscle and fibrous growths from the uterus, either through a scope or abdominal incision. </p>
                    <a id="hysterectomy" class="font-weight-bold">Hysterectomy</a>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">Removal of the uterus.  The tubes and ovaries may be removed at the same time depending on the circumstances. Often the tubes are removed at the time of the hysterectomy as they are a source of cancer and they have no function after childbearing. Ovaries may be retained if the patient desires them for hormones and if they appear normal. Hysterectomies are done through minimally invasive techniques unless the uterus is too large or other masses or complications require a larger incision. The preferred method, if possible, is to remove the uterus vaginally. Vaginal hysterectomy has been shown to have the lowest complication rate. </p>

            <p class="lead mb-0">
                    <a id="hpv" class="font-weight-bold">HPV Testing</a>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">We can now test the cervix for HPV or Human Papillomavirus. This is a virus that can cause cervical cancer. It is very common and most females (about 80%) will have one of the strains of this virus at some time in their lives. Most of the time the infection goes away by itself. Testing for HPV can help provide further information on how to follow abnormal PAP smears. It can also be used in general screening in patients with normal PAP smears to lengthen the time between PAP smears from 1 to three or more years. </p>
                    <a id="apap" class="font-weight-bold">Abnormal PAP Smears/HPV</a>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">A PAP smear is a scraping of skin-like cells from the cervix that are sent to a lab and evaluated for signs of precancerous or malignant cells. PAP smears should start at 21 years of age regardless of sexual activity, PAP smears are repeated depending on age and the results of the last PAP smear and are done every 1 to 3 years until at least the age of 65. Additional co-testing for HPV ( Human Papilloma Virus) after the age of 30, if neg, may allow up to 5 years between PAP smears.</p>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">PAP smears are abnormal if they show pre-cancer or cancerous cells. These abnormalities are caused by the Human Papilloma Virus. Abnormal cell types are separated into 3 main categories: Mild pre-cancer, Severe pre-cancer, and Cancer. Each category has different names that can be confusing but they all are the same category:
                            <li>Mildly abnormal cells can be called:
                                    <ul>ASCUS (Atypical Cells of Uncertain Significance)</ul>  
                                    <ul>Mild Dysplasia</ul>
                                    <ul>CIN 1 (Cervical Intra-epithelial Neoplasia 1)</ul>
                                    <ul>LGSIL (Low-Grade Intra-epithelial Neoplasia)</ul>    
                                <br>
                                </li>
                                    <ul>Severely abnormal cells can be called:
                                        <ul>Moderate to Severe Dysplasia</ul>
                                        <ul>CIN 2 to 3 (Cervical Intra-epithelial Neoplasia 2 to 3)</ul>
                                        <ul>HGSIL (High-Grade Squamous Inter-epithelial Lesions)</ul>
                                        <ul>Carcinoma in Situ</ul>
                                    </li>
                        </p>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">When abnormalities are found in gland cells, (Atypical Glandular Cells), it is more worrisome than the Squamous (skin-like) cells. Abnormal glands cells can progress to cancer more quickly.</p>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">The treatment or follow up of abnormal PAP smears is also less aggressive in women from 21 to 30 years of age as the immune system is so robust that the cells will most likely return to normal. Surgery to remove abnormal cells from the cervix can weaken the cervix and lead to pregnancy loss or premature delivery of an infant. In most cases, even in women over 30 years of age, these cells can be carefully watched with PAP smears and biopsies without any other intervention as long as they do not become severely abnormal.</p>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">When PAP smears are found to be abnormal, the cervix can be further evaluated with biopsies that are directed by the use of a magnifying device called a Colposcope. The biopsies feel like a pinch or a cramp and the sample is sent to pathology and evaluated for pre-cancer or cancer cells. Taking Motrin before the procedure makes it more comfortable.</p>

                    <a id="ovcyst" class="font-weight-bold">Ovarian Cysts</a>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">Cysts are fluid-filled sacs and often occur naturally on the ovary before it releases an egg. Sometimes the cysts become enlarged and can cause pelvic pressure or sudden and prolonged pain. They can even cause the ovary to twist, lose its blood supply, resulting in damage or the loss of an ovary. They are very common in childbearing years.</p>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">Cysts are benign about 99% of the time before menopause. They are usually diagnosed by imaging such as an Ultrasound or CT scan. They usually resolve on their own. If they are not causing symptoms, it is safe to watch them most of the time. Often, we recommend repeating an ultrasound every few months to see if it is getting smaller. If the cyst requires removal, it can usually be done through small incisions with a scope, as an outpatient.</p>
                    <a id="avag" class="font-weight-bold">Abnormal Vaginal Bleeding</a>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">Vaginal bleeding is abnormal if it occurs more frequently than every 21 days, lasts longer than 8 days, occurs between normal monthly periods or after intercourse. Women should not soak more than 30 maxi-pads in a cycle or more than a maxi pad an hour, for two hours in a row.</p>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">Abnormal bleeding may be caused by hormonal irregularities such as PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) or peri-menopause as well as other hormonal irregularities. It can be caused by abnormal pregnancies. It may be due to trauma.</p>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">Abnormal Vaginal Bleeding can be caused by clotting abnormalities.  Irregularity of periods should always be reported to your doctor so that an appropriate investigation can be recommended if indicated. Labs and Ultrasound are the most common types of evaluation, but biopsies may be required, especially as a woman gets nearer to menopausal and has a greater chance of pre-cancer and cancer of the uterus.</p>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">All bleeding that occurs after menopause should be reported as the chances of malignancy are greater when bleeding occurs.</p>
                    <a id="menc" class="font-weight-bold">Menstrual Cramps</a>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">(DYSMENORRHEA):  Cramping with periods can be normal if it is mild and resolves with Motrin. If it is not controlled with over the counter medications, it should be investigated. This condition is treated with hormonal birth control to prevent ovulation, such as birth control pills or Depo-Provera (birth control shot). If this is not effective and the pain is becoming worse and accompanied by pain with intercourse (DYSPAREUNIA), further investigation with laparoscopy or other prescription medications may be indicated.  Most women can be treated effectively and not have their lives disrupted by severe cramps.</p>
                    <a id="pelp" class="font-weight-bold">Pelvic Pain</a>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">A symptom that requires further investigation. It may be as simple as a new work out routine that has strained a muscle or a serious life-threatening disease such as appendicitis. Most often it is a self-limited diagnosis such as an ovarian cyst that has leaked fluid, that will dissolve on its own. If the pain is severe and persistent and not relieved in a short time or with over the counter medications, it will probably require further investigation at the office or in the emergency room if it is severe. It is most important to seek urgent care if you could be pregnant.</p>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">It is very important to notice as many details about the pain as possible and report them to your provider. Such as, when did the pain occur, how long has it been present, is it related to the menstrual cycle or intercourse and are there any associated symptoms such as fever, chills, vaginal discharge, or bleeding. If you have had a new sexual partner it is important to let us know. It is also important to know what makes it better or worse. This information along with an exam, lab test and sometimes and ultrasound can diagnose most causes and allow effective treatment to relieve your pain</p>
                    <a id="infert" class="font-weight-bold">Infertility</a>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">A woman is considered infertile if she has had unprotected intercourse (no birth control) for a year and has not conceived. Women over 35 years old should seek help if they have not conceived in 6 months. Fertility decreases with age.</p>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">Fertility can be improved in obese women by weight loss. Which helps improve ovulation. This is also true for weight gain in very thin women or women who exercise vigorously.</p>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">A workup usually involves lab tests of hormones and a semen analysis to rule out malefactors which are found in 40% of infertile couples. A test to confirm that the Fallopian tubes are open should also be performed. Treatment often involves taking medication to improve ovulation or sperm count and motility.</p>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">Intrauterine insemination of sperm can also be performed. If a tube is obstructed, surgery may be performed. In-Vitro fertilization (IVF), in which the egg and sperm are brought together and fertilization takes place outside the woman's body can be performed to bypass obstructed tubes. The fertilized egg or embryo is then placed back inside the woman's body. IVF can also be used to improve fertility if less invasive treatments are not successful.</p>
                    <a id="utfib" class="font-weight-bold">Uterine Fibroids</a>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">Fibroids are muscle and fibrous growths in the uterus. They usually do not cause symptoms and are almost always benign. They may cause heavy menstrual cycles, pelvic pressure, including urinary frequency and constipation. They can also make it difficult to get pregnant.</p>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">If there are no symptoms, they may not require any treatment. Treatment may be as easy as hormonal therapy to control bleeding or as extreme as removal of the fibroid if childbearing is desired or hysterectomy if not. They can also be treated by radiologists who place beads to obstruct their blood supply or destruction (ablation) of the uterine lining to decrease menstrual bleeding. The treatment is tailored to the individual's needs and symptoms.</p>
                    <a id="std" class="font-weight-bold">Sexually Transmitted Diseases</a>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">These infections are spread during sexual activity of any type.</p>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">The most common infections are:
                            <li>Chlamydia</li>
                            <li>Gonorrhea</li>
                            <li>Herpes</li>
                            <li>Genital Warts (HPV)</li>
                            <li>Trichomoniasis</li>
                            <li>Hepatitis A, B, C</li>
                            <li>HIV</li>
                            </p>
                        <p class="font-weight-normal">These infections can be present even if you have no symptoms. Screening is recommended for sexually active young women every year when they are 25 years old or younger for gonorrhea and chlamydia and older women who have more than one partner or do not use condoms. Screening is recommended for Hepatitis B if you have more than one partner. Check for Hepatitis C IF you were born between 1945 and 19665. Pregnant women should be screened during pregnancy for Syphilis, Chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV, and Hepatitis B.</p>

      <p class="font-weight-normal">We would like to see you for your first visit as soon as possible, usually 6-8 weeks from your last normal period. At that visit, we will review your history and perform a physical exam. An Ultrasound is done to confirm the due date of your baby and look for signs of problems.</p>
      <p class="font-weight-normal">Please do not take any medications that are not prescribed or listed below. Anytime you are prescribed or given a medication, please remind the caregiver that you are pregnant or after pregnancy if you are breastfeeding. </p>
      <p class="font-weight-normal">The following medications are alright to take for a few days or occasionally:</p>
      <p class="font-weight-normal">
        <ul>
          <li>

        <p class="font-weight-normal">Do not use Ibuprofen products or any prescription medications without consulting us. Never hesitate to consult us about your medication questions.</p>
        <p class="font-weight-normal"><u>Second visit:</u></p>
        <p class="font-weight-normal">About 12 weeks gestation (twelve weeks from your last period) we will obtain your prenatal lab panel. You will meet with the physician and discuss the course of your prenatal care. This is a time to bring your concerns and questions so we can form a partnership in planning your pregnancy. You will receive a folder of educational material that you will be able to refer to throughout your pregnancy.  </p>
        <p class="font-weight-normal">We know how special pregnancy and birth are for each mom and we are compelled to help you achieve the experience you are looking for.</p>
        <p class="font-weight-normal">It is not unusual to have spot bleeding in the first trimester, especially after intercourse. If this occurs, please call us to see if further evaluation with an ultrasound is warranted.</p>
        <p class="font-weight-normal">As part of our prenatal testing, we offer testing looking for birth defects such as spina bifida chromosomal abnormalities that include blood tests. We also offer special ultrasounds that show the thickness of the skin of the baby's neck (nuchal translucency) looking for signs of Down's Syndrome and Turner's Syndrome.</p>
        <p  class="font-weight-normal"><strong>Second Trimester:</strong></p>
        <p class="font-weight-normal">In the second trimester, we will see you every 4 weeks if there are no complications. Between 18-20 weeks is the best time for an ultrasound to look at the anatomy of the baby. It will also check on the growth of the baby, confirm its gender, and access the fluid around the baby. </p>
        <p class="font-weight-normal">At about 28 weeks we will screen for gestational diabetes as many gestational diabetics have no risk factors. </p>
        <p  class="font-weight-normal"> <strong>Third Trimester:</strong></p>
        <p class="font-weight-normal">In the third trimester, from 28 to 36 weeks we will see you every 2 weeks to continue checking blood pressure, weight gain, and fetal growth by measuring the fundal height. Ultrasounds for growth and tests for fetal well being such as Non-stress test or Biophysical Profiles will be done as needed.</p>
        <p class="font-weight-normal">From 36 weeks on, you will be seen weekly. This is the time you will let us know your wishes for labor and delivery including methods of pain relief, positioning, breastfeeding, and if you are having a boy, circumcision. We will answer all your questions in these areas and make a personal plan for your delivery.</p>
        <p class="font-weight-normal">We recommend "kangaroo care" or "skin to skin" immediately after your baby is born to improve breastfeeding, your baby's growth, neurological development, and sleeping. This involves lying the baby on your abdomen when he/she deliverers, cleaning them off as we wait to cut the cord, and then placing him/her on your chest after drying, stimulating, and accessing your baby. The first hour is a unique experience and is a wonderful chance to bond and improve your baby's health. Dad can do "skin to skin" too! </p>
        <p class="font-weight-normal">"The first hour of life outside the womb is a special time. This once in a lifetime experience should not be interrupted unless the baby or mother is unstable and requires medical resuscitation. It is a "sacred" time that should be honored, cherished, and protected whenever possible." (Raylene Phillips, MD, FAAP)</p>
